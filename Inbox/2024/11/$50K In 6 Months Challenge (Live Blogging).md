On September 08, 2024, I decided to start the challenge of making $50,000 in 6 months. The motivation behind this challenge is that:

 * Our apartment lease expires at the end of December 2024.

## September 08, 2024 Update

On September 08, 2024, I decided to start the challenge of making $50,000 in 6 months. The motivation behind this challenge is that:

-   Our apartment lease expires at the end of December 2024.
-   We are expecting our baby girl around the same time.

That means we have to move from our current apartment.

Fortunately, we are in the process of building our own house, which is approximately 65% complete. With an additional $50,000, we believe we can make the house livable, even if it's not entirely finished.

Despite my initial hesitation, I decided to share this challenge on Twitter/X. To my surprise, the post received an overwhelmingly positive response from the community. At the time of writing, the post has 177.5K views _(click on the image to see the post)_.

To reach the $50,000 goal within 6 months, I plan to do the following:

1.  Develop a SaaS product targeting content creators
2.  Complete and launch my [technical writing course](https://technicalwriting.online/?utm_source=50k_post) (currently 75% done)
3.  Get sponsorships on my YouTube channel
4.  Write paid technical articles
5.  ~Offer~ [~mentorship sessions~](https://catal.ink/writing-consultation?ref=catalins.tech)
6.  Include sponsors in this blog post

Let's give it a go and see if I manage to complete the challenge successfully. Here's how you can stay updated:

## September 14, 2024 Update

Since the challenge started, I've managed to:

-   Land a $700 technical writing gig
-   Made a couple of sales for the [technical writing course](https://technicalwriting.online/?utm_source=50k_post)

At the moment, I'm 5.88% of the way towards my $50,000 goal.
