Software development teams are under constant pressure to deliver more in less time. But how do you keep up the pace? Setting up your team for success requires collaboration, constructive communication, and timely teamwork. And as you probably know, small steps can make a world of difference — like how an Olympian can win by just a few seconds. One small step we’d like to highlight is linking code commits to tickets/projects/issues. It might seem like a minor detail, but here are 5 reasons why this simple step can make a huge difference for your team.

## How to Link Code Commits to Tickets in Assembla

Before we start, here is a quick tutorial on how to link code commits to tickets in Assembla: 

-   Link commits to tickets by writing re _#ticket\_number—_such as _re_ _#122—_anywhere in the commit messages.
-   Change the Ticket status by writing _status #ticket\_number. For instance,_  including _Test #4_ in your commit message will change the status of Ticket #4 to Test. The status name in this case is not case-sensitive.

<sup>By adding ‘re #ticket_number’ and ‘&lt;status&gt; #ticket_number’ to your commit messages on your chosen platform, you can automatically link the commit to an Assembla ticket and update its status simultaneously.</sup>

Now, let’s talk about why you should link code commits to tickets. Organizations that want to ship quality products faster and maintain a competitive edge need to prioritize fostering strong collaboration within their development teams. But collaboration isn’t about overwhelming your team with countless tools, channels or meetings. Instead, it’s about streamlining existing processes. Achieve more with what you already have — and that’s exactly what linking code commits to tickets enables. It helps your team collaborate, communicate, and deliver better products without disrupting their preferred workflow.

## Link Code Commits to Tickets for Clearer Communication

We’ve all experienced those moments when it’s hard to keep track of what’s done and what’s still in progress. By linking code commits to tickets, project managers can easily see the status of tasks — knowing exactly what’s been completed and what’s still in the pipeline. At Assembla, even our marketing team uses tickets to stay organized, keep track of upcoming product updates, and maintain a clear view of all ongoing initiatives. This simple process keeps communication flowing smoothly without the need for extra tools, which leads us to the next benefit of linking code commits to tickets.

[DevOps](https://get.assembla.com/blog/devops-outsourcing/) teams often rely on multiple tools to manage their work, but this can quickly become draining and counterproductive. Instead of streamlining workflows, project managers end up losing valuable time and resources managing tool sprawl — the constant onboarding of new tools, configuring complex integrations, duplicating permission settings, duplicating information, and dealing with fragmented communication. These inefficiencies can create confusion, slow down progress, and inflate costs. 

At Assembla, we’ve seen clients who initially used only our [version control](https://get.assembla.com/blog/how-to-choose-version-control-system/) platform significantly improve their workflows after adopting our [project management tool](https://get.assembla.com/projects). By simply linking code commits to tickets in Assembla, they’re able to focus their efforts on a single, unified platform, making their work that much more efficient and productive.

## Create a Single Source of Truth  

Speaking of a single platform, here’s the third reason to link code commits to tickets in Assembla. As mentioned earlier, Assembla allows you to [centralize your projects on one platform](https://get.assembla.com/blog/why-merge-project-management-version-control/), eliminating the need to juggle multiple tools or duplicate tasks. But the benefits go beyond that. By linking commits to tickets, each ticket is now connected to its full history. This means the next developer can easily read the commit messages and know exactly what has been done. We’ve all been in projects where, after a team member leaves, no one really knows what’s going on or what’s been completed. Having a single [source of truth](https://get.assembla.com/blog/source-control-with-git-to-improve-collaboration/) solves that problem, ensuring clarity and continuity across your team.

## Use Dependency Tasks to Enhance Handoffs

One of our favorite features in Assembla tickets is the ability to create dependency tasks. For example, you can create tickets that should be completed before or after another ticket is addressed. But even if different people are assigned to each ticket, they can still check the commit messages and see what was done in the parent ticket. Besides, developers and project managers can simply use @mentions in the comment section to pass the baton. As a result, [communication](https://get.assembla.com/blog/software-development-teams-communicate-better/) and workflows are streamlined in such a way that a new briefing is unnecessary. 

## Manage what is happening all the time, in real-time

If you’re a [manager handling multiple projects](https://get.assembla.com/blog/program-management-software/), linking code commits to tickets can be a game-changer. With tickets automatically updating in real-time, you’ll always know who’s working on what and who’s available to tackle a new high-priority task. Over time, this gives you a clear overview of your backlog, bottlenecks, and overall progress. As a result, we are confident you will be able to organize priorities and your team’s schedules more efficiently. Plus, you can grant access to customer support and allow them to stay informed about updates and improvements in real-time.

Linking code commits to tickets may sound like a small step in the grand scheme of things. But the domino effect on your communication, workflow and teamwork is undeniable. And since it is so simple anyway, you might as well give it a shot. The results will surprise you.
