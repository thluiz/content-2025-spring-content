The LeadingEng conference has posted the video of my talk “The Path From Director to CTO: How to Follow It or How to Mentor It” on their website (you need to have a LeadDev.com account, but that is free) [https://leaddev.com/leadingeng-new-york-2024/videos/path-director-cto-how-follow-it-or-how-mentor-it](https://leaddev.com/leadingeng-new-york-2024/videos/path-director-cto-how-follow-it-or-how-mentor-it).

For those in the Raleigh/Durham area this week, I’ll be there for the Business of Software conference. If you are at the conference, reach out! If you’re local, [let me know](mailto://contact@itdependsbook.net). I’ll set up a coffee or meetup if I hear from people.

If you are new to the newsletter, please check out the [archives on Substack](https://kevingoldsmith.substack.com/). Of course, you can always [buy the book](https://itdependsbook.net/#availability).

## Newest Blog Post

Creating the newsletter or podcast every week and promoting the book has seriously impacted my blogging frequency, but I published a new blog post last month: “[You should give that talk or write that blog](https://blog.kevingoldsmith.com/2024/08/09/you-should-give-that-talk-or-write-that-blog/).” It answers the questions I often get from folks considering launching a blog or speaking at a conference.

## About this newsletter

If you are new to this newsletter, here’s what makes it unique. Every two weeks, I share a chapter from my book [It Depends: Writing on Technology Leadership 2012-2022](https://itdependsbook.net/), which Unit Circle Press released in March. These chapters are not in sequential order, but each one is a standalone piece. In addition, a podcast serializes the audiobook in order, released in the alternate weeks from this newsletter.

## The Latest Podcast

The latest episode of the podcast is “Writing Useful Performance Reviews: Evaluating the data and writing the review.” This episode is the second part of a four-part series on writing performance reviews. This episode’s extra content includes me spilling the tea on Microsoft performance reviews and discussing my favorite and least favorite performance review frameworks.

You can get the episode at [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/it-depends-lessons-in-technology-leadership/id1724860326), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0I04WEW66wccT1mkQTgJCT?si=pFoEEzrTRK2JKHf-uBvAiw), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi3WK7xc12t260xo62YTDcxzM6Ezov1wm&si=3ysF33uC99GXEJd4), [directly via the RSS Feed](https://podcast.itdependsbook.net/feed.xml), or wherever you get your podcasts (see [pod.link](https://pod.link/1724860326) for a more extensive list).

You can also share your thoughts on Substack or the various podcast platforms. Your feedback is invaluable, and I look forward to hearing from you.

## About this week’s chapter

This week’s chapter comes from a blog post and [a talk](https://www.kevingoldsmith.com/talks/when-why-and-how-to-stop-coding-as-your-day-job.html) I’ve given a couple of times at ConFoo and the Tech Leadership Conference. It is one of the most frequent questions from technical leads and engineering managers, so I thought I would write a talk and blog post about it. In this chapter, I try to explain why it is hard for many of us to step out of day-to-day coding for our teams, but I also explain why it is necessary if you want to follow the engineering management career path. As I discuss in the chapter, it was a tough decision for me. My manager had to challenge me to look at my impact on the team by insisting on owning features. Hopefully, this chapter can help you avoid the same mistake.

This is chapter 4 of [It Depends](https://itdependsbook.net/).

## When, why, and how to stop coding as your day job

By letting go of writing code, you open yourself up to excelling as a manager.

_Originally published on March 12, 2021_

## I am a computer programmer.

I was one of those people who started coding at a young age – in my case, on a TRS-80 Model 1 in my school’s library. I loved teaching the computer to do something and then enjoying the results of interacting with what I built. Since I didn’t own a computer, I would fill spiral-bound notebooks with programs I would write at home. Then, as soon as I could get time on the computer, I would type it in line by line. When I learned that I could write software as a job, I couldn’t imagine anything else I would want to do.

After graduating from university, I got my dream job writing 3D graphics code. I was a software engineer! I defined a successful day by how much code I wrote, the compiler issues I resolved, and the bugs I closed. These were obvious, objective metrics that I could use to measure my work. Those metrics and my job defined me.

Today, I am a Chief Technology Officer, leading large software development organizations. If I am writing code on the product, it is probably a bad thing. I now have to define my success by much fuzzier metrics: building good teams, hiring and training good people, setting multi-year technical strategy and vision for the company, collaborating with other departments, and setting and managing a budget. I may have a good or bad day, but I must measure my success based on quarters or years.

My achievements are now always tied to the successes of others. Getting to this point wasn’t easy, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. The journey took years. The first challenge was understanding that coding was no longer my job.

## Why is it hard to stop coding as our day-to-day work?

When I speak to engineering leads or managers working to grow into more senior engineering leadership levels, the question of ‘How much do you code?’ is very often raised. We usually have a hard time imagining that we can still be useful if we don’t code for a significant part of our time. Why is that?

### We’ve been traditionally bad at hiring managers in the software engineering industry

Usually, companies choose development leads because they are the best, technically, on the team. I would guess that the reasoning behind this is the assumption that the best developers are the right people to supervise their peers. Unfortunately, this practice creates the impression that managing others is a promotion for a skilled developer when, in actuality, it is a career change away from what made them successful in the first place.

The worst managers I’ve had were very talented developers who hated spending time doing the “boring” stuff that wasn’t coding. They resented the time spent away from the keyboard and weren’t always good at hiding that fact.

Many companies now feature dual career tracks for technologists, allowing them to advance as individual contributors or move into management. This choice of career is an excellent thing. It means that if you want to spend your days coding, you can do that without sacrificing your career. It also means that if you prefer to find your joy in leading teams and growing others’ development and skills, you can do that.

### We fear becoming ‘non-technical’

We joined the technology industry to be close to technology. We fear that by moving away from coding, we will morph into the classic ‘pointy-haired boss’ – ridiculed by the people on our team and unable to understand what the developers are discussing. I won’t say this can’t happen, but it won’t happen on its own. It will only happen if you avoid technology once you move into management.

As you take on broader leadership responsibilities, you must learn and understand new technologies. Moving beyond the specifics of your expertise is necessary to move up in management. I have managed developers coding in at least a dozen languages on the backend, frontend, mobile, operating systems, and native applications. I have also managed testers, data scientists, data engineers, DevOps, Security, designers, data analysts, program managers, product managers, corporate IT teams, and others. It isn’t possible to be an expert in all those fields. I need to take the lessons from my time as a developer and use them to inform my understanding, help me learn new areas, and give me empathy for the people who work for me.

It isn’t that you will become non-technical. It is that you will become _less narrowly technical._

### As new managers, we are often expected to continue coding

It is common to move from being a developer on a team to managing that team. As the new manager, this means you are still responsible for part of the codebase. Unless you immediately start leading a large group, your new role may require you to spend a significant portion of your time coding. This expectation makes the transition to the new role more comfortable – but it can also be an anchor that holds you back from embracing your new role as your management responsibilities grow.

### We still see ourselves as a resource that can ‘save’ a deliverable

As a manager, you are accountable for the results of your team. If the group struggles to make a deadline, it might be tempting to jump into the weeds to try and help the team finish the project on time. While this is sometimes the right decision, it can also worsen the problems because the team loses the person who looks at the more significant issues and coordinates with other teams to get more help or prepare them for the delay.

## Why do we need to stop coding eventually?

We don’t need to stop coding, ever. However, once you move into engineering leadership, it will need to become a smaller and smaller part of your job if you are working to lead larger teams or broaden your responsibilities.  
I had led teams before I was a manager at Adobe, and I had always spent a significant part of my work week contributing code as part of the groups I was in. At Adobe, though, my team had grown to be fourteen people, with another four dotted-lined to me.

I had been the primary developer for a part of the project, and I still took pride in contributing important features to every release. However, my management responsibilities were starting to fill my work weeks. Between 1:1s, sync meetings with other teams, and other manager work, my feature development time was increasingly moving into my evenings and weekends. As a result, my features were often the last to be merged and usually late.

The company had two mandatory shut-down weeks. To work during this time, you needed the prior approval of a Vice-President. The team was preparing for a release, and my features were still in the to-do column; I met with my VP to get his permission to work over the shut-down week. He asked me, ‘Who is the worst developer on your team?’ I hemmed and hawed – I didn’t want to call out anyone on my team, and I hadn’t even considered the question. Finally, seeing my uncertainty, he answered for me. ‘You are! You’re always late with your features. The rest of the team is always waiting on you. If you were a developer instead of the manager, you would be on a performance improvement plan.’ He was right. My insistence on coding was hurting the team, not helping it.

Taking on the lead role doesn’t mean you should stop coding immediately, but it does mean that your coding responsibilities should now be secondary to your leadership ones. Other developers are on your team, but there aren’t other leads. If you aren’t doing your lead job, no one else will. Similarly, your professional development’s primary focus should now be your leadership skills, not your coding skills. You are moving into a new career, and if you don’t work to improve, you will find yourself stuck.

As your leadership responsibilities increase, you should transition your development responsibilities to other team members. This transition is good practice because **delegation is an essential part of leadership.**

## How do you stay ‘technical’ when coding is no longer your job?

As I said earlier, staying technical is a choice you must make. Hopefully, one of the primary reasons you chose to make a career in the technology industry was that you were interested in it, so this shouldn’t be a problem.

As I also said earlier, as you develop as a technology leader, your focus broadens as your scope widens.

The best way that I have found to remain a credible technologist for my teams is to be interested in them and their work. To do this, talk to the team members and take a genuine interest in their work. If a technology comes up in a meeting or 1:1 that you don’t know, add it to a list of things to research later. Then, dedicate time in your week to go through that list and learn about the technologies on your list well enough to have your own opinions about them. This practice allows you to have further discussions with whoever mentioned the technology.

If you get interested in what you learn about the new technology, you may want to keep trying to understand it better; you may read more or embark on a personal project using it to gain more practical knowledge. As I said, it isn’t that you must stop coding. It is that, eventually, it shouldn’t be your day job anymore.

By taking an interest in the technologies your team uses in their work, you deepen your empathy for them and expand your knowledge. You’ll be able to discuss the work, ask reasonable questions, and make connections to other things happening in the organization and your own experience. This way, the people on your team know that while you may not be able to step in for them, you understand their work and care about it.

## Success is defined differently when you lead people

The feeling of accomplishment that comes from completing a cool user story, deploying a new service, or fixing a difficult bug is significant. It is a dopamine hit, and just like other dopamine-inducing behaviors, it can be hard to stop.

Having a great 1:1 or leading a productive team meeting can also feel good but in a more esoteric way. As a team leader, you must learn to perceive the success of making others successful. This type of success takes longer, but the feeling is more profound and more rewarding.

Having a release resonate with your customers, being able to easily justify the promotion of a developer you have mentored, and having someone accept a job offer for your team, are all fantastic feelings. In the day-to-day, watching stories get completed, helping resolve the issues when they aren’t, and seeing people get excited about the direction you’re setting for the team can leave you feeling satisfied at the end of the day.

## Being a technical leader doesn’t mean writing code every day

As you grow in your new leadership career, you must devote time to mentoring, developing, and leading your team. As you spend less time in your code editor, you will find new challenges in strategy, clearing roadblocks, fixing broken processes, and new tools like HR information systems, slides, and spreadsheets (it isn’t as bad as it sounds). You will spend less time learning all the intricacies of a specific language or toolchain. Instead, you will learn about how systems interact, understand when to build vs. buy, and learn about new technology areas. And you can still code, but make sure you aren’t the developer holding your team back.
