9 days for a system to boot up while telling you its total uptime is less than 1 minute. This is some amazing work.

Finally someone has solved the problem of boot messages going by too quickly to read them.

It does not matter that this thing takes a week to boot. You literally got Linux running on a freaking FOUR FUNCTION CALCULATOR CHIP. Alan Turing would be most pleased to see his theory being proven in practice.

I was shocked how fast linux work on 4004 and mid video I realized how fast clock work Still I'm in shock it works at all great job

This video starts on September 10th at 3:47pm. It ends September 18th, at just after 9pm. The little USB-C port indicates the system is consuming 6.3W the entire time. Over the 197 hours of operation this 4004 consumed over 1.2kWh of energy just to boot Linux and run three commands. congratulations, you now have the most inefficient linux machine ever built.

I LOL'd when I saw the delay loop calculation during the startup -- bogomips: 0.00. Yep, that makes sense. :D

finally something to impress arch users

According to my napkin calc, it's running at x0.000055 realtime. By the time it prints uptime, only 41 seconds have passed for the kernel (meanwhile, 206.5 hours (8 days + [14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQZZ21WZZr0&t=870s)) have passed IRL). That's some serious time dilation. I am impressed. :D

Now someone needs to port Linux to one of those vacuum tube computers.

Thanks, this was interesting! Makes you realize how blazingly fast current CPUs are.

Finally someone doing something real with the 4004, while it may not be the most powerful... it showed the way to a monolithic CPU on a single die, running Linux on a four bit processor no less

dmitry, this is a work of genius, art and beauty, and i take a bow. A new high in low.

Like driving to the moon in a VW beetle. Well done!

I can't believe I'm seeing this today. Congratulations!

That is one of the coolest things I have seen in a long time! How amazing - the first microprocessor running a real OS even if though emulation.

This literally puts a meaning into "I'll grow a beard until it boots"

Glad to be witnessing history in the making. My dad would have loved it; he used to build and maintain analog computers for Mountain Bell telephone company in the 70s.

The 32-bit MIPS emulator in (less than) 4K of code is really amazing!

A worthy successor to Linux on an AVR
