> The first thing to understand is that hackers actually like hard  
> problems and good, thought-provoking questions about them. If we  
> didn’t, we wouldn’t be here. If you give us an interesting question  
> to chew on we’ll be grateful to you; good questions are a stimulus  
> and a gift. Good questions help us develop our understanding, and  
> often reveal problems we might not have noticed or thought about  
> otherwise. Among hackers, “Good question!” is a strong and sincere  
> compliment.
> 
> Despite this, hackers have a reputation for meeting simple  
> questions with what looks like hostility or arrogance. It sometimes  
> looks like we’re hostile to newbies and the ignorant. But this  
> isn’t really true.
> 
> What we are, unapologetically, is hostile to people who seem to  
> be unwilling to to think or do their own homework before asking  
> questions. People like that are time sinks — they take without  
> giving back, they waste time we could have spent on another  
> question more interesting and another person more worthy of an  
> answer. We call people like this “losers” (and for historical  
> reasons we sometimes spell it “lusers”).”
