Hello guys, if you are preparing for Tech interviews but struggling on System Design interviews then you are not alone. System Design is one of the toughest topic for anyone giving Interview.

Though you can overcome this by preparing well and choosing right resources. If you are looking for resources to learn and level up your Software design skills then you have come to the right place.

Earlier I have shared System design resources like [courses](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/7-best-software-design-course-for-programmers-and-developers-da3e18e9135), [books](https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-10-system-design-interview-books-in-2024-3e69e182e092), [websites,](https://medium.com/javarevisited/7-best-places-to-learn-system-design-79e2d261f343) [newsletters](https://medium.com/javarevisited/5-best-system-design-publications-and-newsletters-for-software-engineers-in-2024-54b8c8c5f65c), [cheat sheets](https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-3-system-design-cheat-sheets-templates-and-roadmap-for-software-engineering-interviews-53012952db28), [mock interviews](https://medium.com/javarevisited/3-best-mock-interview-platforms-for-system-design-and-coding-interviews-in-2024-7283f1579b17), [blogs](https://medium.com/javarevisited/40-must-read-engineering-blogs-to-learn-system-design-and-software-architecture-in-2024-aaa7c4f71ee6), [tips](https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-tips-for-system-design-interviews-fb3c2b6e4020), [GitHub repo](https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-best-github-repositories-to-prepare-for-system-design-interviews-6cc9d37d50f6), and [Problems](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2024/05/100-system-design-interview-questions.html), and today I am going to share case studies and tutorials.

These are quite in-depth articles and you will learn a lot about how real world system works, how common problems are solved and how to build Software which are robust, scalable and can withstand test of time in production.

By the way, if you are preparing for System design interviews and want to learn System Design in depth then you can also checkout sites like [**ByteByteGo**](https://bit.ly/3P3eqMN), [**Design Guru**](https://bit.ly/3pMiO8g), [**Exponent**](https://bit.ly/3cNF0vw), [**Educative**](https://bit.ly/3Mnh6UR), [**Codemia.io**](https://codemia.io/?via=javarevisited) and [**Udemy**](https://bit.ly/3vFNPid) which have many great System design courses
