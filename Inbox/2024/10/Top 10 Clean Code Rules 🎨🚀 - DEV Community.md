When writing code, it's like writing a story. A good story is easy to read, and you understand what's happening right away. The same goes for code! Clean code is not just for computers; it‚Äôs for other developers too. Here are the top 10 rules that will help you write code like a pro!

## [](https://dev.to/anikakash/top-10-clean-code-rules-13i6?context=digest#1-use-meaningful-names)1\. Use Meaningful Names

Give your variables, functions, and classes names that clearly describe what they do. For example, instead of `x` or `y`, use `totalScore` or `userName`. It‚Äôs like naming your toys‚Äîyou don‚Äôt call them just ‚Äútoy 1‚Äù or ‚Äútoy 2,‚Äù right?

## [](https://dev.to/anikakash/top-10-clean-code-rules-13i6?context=digest#2-keep-functions-small)2\. Keep Functions Small

A function should do only one thing and do it well. If your function is too long, it can be confusing. Imagine trying to learn 10 magic tricks at once! It's much easier if you focus on one at a time.

## [](https://dev.to/anikakash/top-10-clean-code-rules-13i6?context=digest#3-dont-repeat-yourself-dry)3\. Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself (DRY)

If you find yourself writing the same code over and over again, try to combine it into a single function. Think about it‚Äîif you have one awesome magic trick, why not reuse it instead of making new ones every time?

## [](https://dev.to/anikakash/top-10-clean-code-rules-13i6?context=digest#4-use-comments-wisely)4\. Use Comments Wisely

Comments should explain _why_ something is happening, not _what_ is happening. The code itself should be clear enough. Imagine you wrote a secret message for your friend‚Äîyou wouldn‚Äôt explain every single word, only the tricky parts.

## [](https://dev.to/anikakash/top-10-clean-code-rules-13i6?context=digest#5-consistent-formatting)5\. Consistent Formatting

Keep your code looking neat. Use proper spacing, indentation, and line breaks. Just like a tidy room is easier to move around in, clean and organized code is easier to read and understand.

## [](https://dev.to/anikakash/top-10-clean-code-rules-13i6?context=digest#6-avoid-magic-numbers)6\. Avoid Magic Numbers

A magic number is just a random number in your code. If you use numbers, give them names or store them in variables. For example, instead of `12`, use `numberOfMonthsInAYear`. This way, everyone knows what that number means!

## [](https://dev.to/anikakash/top-10-clean-code-rules-13i6?context=digest#7-handle-errors-gracefully)7\. Handle Errors Gracefully

Don‚Äôt just let your code crash if something goes wrong‚Äîwrite code to handle mistakes. If you‚Äôre playing a game, you don‚Äôt want it to freeze if you press the wrong button, right? Similarly, your code should know what to do when something unexpected happens.

## [](https://dev.to/anikakash/top-10-clean-code-rules-13i6?context=digest#8-use-clear-conditions)8\. Use Clear Conditions

When you write `if` statements or loops, make them easy to understand. Instead of doing everything in one line, break it up so others can follow along. It‚Äôs like giving directions‚Äîbe clear, so no one gets lost.

## [](https://dev.to/anikakash/top-10-clean-code-rules-13i6?context=digest#9-keep-things-simple)9\. Keep Things Simple

Don‚Äôt over-complicate things. Simple code is better because it's easier to fix and understand. Think about building a LEGO house‚Äîit‚Äôs much easier to follow the instructions than making up something overly complicated.

## [](https://dev.to/anikakash/top-10-clean-code-rules-13i6?context=digest#10-refactor-regularly)10\. Refactor Regularly

Always look back at your code and see if you can improve it. It‚Äôs like cleaning your room‚Äîyou need to tidy it up now and then to make sure everything is in the right place!

By following these 10 clean code rules, you‚Äôll write code that‚Äôs easy for others to read and understand. It‚Äôs like telling a great story‚Äîclear, simple, and fun!
