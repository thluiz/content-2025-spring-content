You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backwardâ€”reversing cause and effect. I call these the "wet streets cause rain" stories. Paper's full of them. In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know."</p><p>-Michael Crichton</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

The Economist reports on a much larger range of country and topics than the typical magazine or newspaper. Many of its readers like it for that exact reason: it gives them information on stories they won't normally find in their local or national news sources and they want to be informed about, say, hydroelectric developments in the Congo.</p><p>The problem is that writing about 25 different countries in a single issue doesn't mean they actually have experts on most of those places or people on the ground to do original reporting. Often, it devolves into British or American writers regurgitating inaccurate information from the Internet. But if it's the only thing you read about, say, forest exports from Myanmar, you have no reason to question it.</p><p>The easiest way to see this is to be a non-US/UK/EU person and read an article in the Economist about your own country. Then you realize that all the other articles are just as simplistic and uninformed.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="13156395"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_13156395" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=13156395&amp;how=up&amp;auth=e4ab07cbeab473318768a00dd83fea2f30b0e483&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D13155538#13156395"></a></center></td><td><br><div><p>My experience is the opposite.

That gives me confidence in the articles about issues I'm not intimately familiar with.</p><p>That is why The Economist is one of the few news sources I read after cutting out following daily news completely. As a result I'm much better informed about the facts and issues than I was when reading huge amounts of daily news.

The Economist has a few core principles that they hold very dear. Two of these are social liberalism and trade liberalism. They are strong believers in the free market. Applying these principles to issues in the recent past, the Economist took positions in favour of both legalisation of drugs and enacting the Trans Pacific Partnership. Most people (but not all) disagree with one of these stances but not the other. A Reagan Republican would favour trade and "just say no" whereas an Obama Democrat would demonise the TPP and demand the end of a failed, pointless war. It's easy to see how such people would find some stances taken by the Economist as "full-of-shit".</p><p>I'm a long time subscriber to the Economist, ever since I was in high school. I appreciate their breadth of reporting and their commitment to provide opinionated takes on news while also giving a balanced take on news. Very few times have I felt the "Murray Gell-Mann effect" while reading it. I can recall just one instance they have been wrong about a topic I'm knowledgeable about. That's a better record than any other publication I read.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="13161786"><td></td></tr><tr id="13156509"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_13156509" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=13156509&amp;how=up&amp;auth=3816b30ac170a51a6a44e52439707df496cdf962&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D13155538#13156509"></a></center></td><td><br><div><p>Reading the above quote from Micheal Chrichton, I immediately thought about The Economist and how they are usually well informed.

I actually found that the BBCs coverage was the most honest and accurate. This experience has always left me wondering, "If an event that I have personal knowledge of was not reported accurately in the newspapers, how do I know that other events that I do not have personal knowledge of are reported accurately?" It doesn't seem to be enough to use multiple sources since all of the US sources I could find were inaccurate and how would I know if the BBC was always accurate?</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="13159863"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_13159863" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=13159863&amp;how=up&amp;auth=ce9587c0dd96b96fa2f87ae0d09de33947afb86a&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D13155538#13159863"></a></center></td><td><br><div><p>The main way I've found is to just read something from multiple countries.
