I find "what's something you'd like to do before you die" is best asked on night strolls through the woods or near a secluded lake.

"What's something you'd like to do before you die?" Now THAT's a killer conversation starter!

You know you've met the right person when you can be silent and not feel pressured to chatter away mindlessly.

"Im a teacher" "When I was younger, I wanted to become a teacher, theres something fullfilling in inspiring others" "Oh, then why didnt you?" "Cause thats a lie, I cant stand children" Going great so far

"so what's your occupation?" "no, you're supposed to start with family" "... oh, right, okay"

"Hey do you see that guy over there?" "Yeah" "I see him too we both have Good eyes"

and avoid the RAPE method: R: Religion A: Abortion P: Politics E: Economics

Me, watching this to figure out how to make friends at work: "So, what do you do for a living?" "...Bro, we're both here."

"You look like you come from a big family" "Uhhh why do you think so?" "nono, you are supposed to talk about your family now"

Me: "Hey, want a drink?" Girl: "Uh. No, thanks..." Me: "Wow, you know when I was younger I always wanted to buy drinks for strangers. There's something about gifting others that's very fulfilling!" Girl: "I-" Me: "You look like you're from a big family!"

haahahah imagine this: youre on your first date with a girl. its the middle of the night. youre wearing all black. youre in a empty street and you ask her: is there something you wanna do before you die?

The most important thing to know is that you don't have to always be the one keeping the conversation going. If you're the only one asking questions theres a big chance the other person simply doesn't want to talk to you, so go find someone who does, you'll have a much better time.

That guy over there has a social security number, my brother also has a social security number. What is your social security number?

i usually break the ice by slipping and falling straight on it

Me: “You look like you come from a big family.” Her: “Why would you say that?” Me: “Because you’re big, and big people tend to be obese which can be genetic.” Her: “Obesity doesn’t run in my family...” Me: “No one runs in your family.”

Imagine approaching a random person and say "You see that guy over there? He really reminds me of my older brother, who's always energetic and not afraid to let loose. I feel like older sibling are all like that. Do you have any siblings?" By the end of this line, person will be gone already.

Me: Titanic. Person: What? Me: Sorry, not a good ice breaker.

So I started with "you look like you come from a big family." She said "Not all Mexicans do." Then I panicked and remembered your advice and asked "What do you want to do before you die?" Long story short I got a restraining order and think I'm on some sort of list now...

When silence finally brakes in, is usually THEM who gets uncomfortable and feels awkward, not me. Enjoy the silence, my friend

It absolutely blows my mind that some people can just do all of this naturally. It's a painstaking thought process for me every time, and I end up relentlessly focusing on how to have a conversation instead of listening and actually remembering what the person is actually saying.
