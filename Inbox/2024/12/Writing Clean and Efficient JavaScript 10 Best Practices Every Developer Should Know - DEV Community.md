JavaScript is an essential tool in modern web development, but as applications grow in complexity, messy or inefficient code can lead to bugs, performance bottlenecks, and maintainability issues. Writing clean, efficient, and maintainable JavaScript is key to creating scalable applications.

This post will cover **10 essential best practices** to help you streamline your code, optimize performance, and ensure maintainability. These practices include leveraging modern ES6+ features, optimizing workflows, and building scalable architectures. Many of these techniques and tools are discussed in the eBook [**_JavaScript: From ES2015 to ES2023_**](https://qirolab.gumroad.com/l/javascript-from-es2015-to-es2023), your go-to resource for mastering modern JavaScript features.

The introduction of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and subsequent updates have revolutionized JavaScript, making code more concise, readable, and powerful. Features such as destructuring, arrow functions, template literals, and nullish coalescing are must-haves in your toolkit.

For example, nullish coalescing (`??`) ensures cleaner handling of null or undefined values:  

```
<span>const</span> <span>userAge</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>userAge</span> <span>??</span> <span>"</span><span>Default Age</span><span>"</span><span>);</span> <span>// Output: Default Age</span>
```

Optional chaining (`?.`) adds safety when accessing deeply nested properties:  

```
<span>const</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>profile</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>Alice</span><span>"</span> <span>}</span> <span>};</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>profile</span><span>?.</span><span>name</span><span>);</span> <span>// Output: Alice</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>profile</span><span>?.</span><span>age</span><span>);</span>  <span>// Output: undefined</span>
```

For a detailed exploration of these and other features, refer to [**_JavaScript: From ES2015 to ES2023_**](https://qirolab.gumroad.com/l/javascript-from-es2015-to-es2023).

Modular programming makes codebases more organized, maintainable, and scalable. ES6 module syntax allows you to encapsulate functionality and share it across your application.  

```
<span>// math.js</span>
<span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// app.js</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>add</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>./math.js</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>));</span> <span>// Output: 5</span>
```

This approach enables reusability and simplifies debugging.

## [](https://dev.to/hkp22/writing-clean-and-efficient-javascript-10-best-practices-every-developer-should-know-20be?context=digest#3-lint-and-format-your-code)3\. **Lint and Format Your Code**

Consistent coding style is critical for readability and maintainability. Tools like **ESLint** help enforce coding standards by catching errors early, while **Prettier** automatically formats your code for a uniform appearance.  

```
<span># Install ESLint and Prettier</span>
npm <span>install </span>eslint prettier <span>--save-dev</span>
```

For event-heavy applications, such as those using `scroll` or `resize`, unoptimized event handling can degrade performance. Debouncing and throttling control the rate at which functions execute, improving responsiveness.

-   **Debouncing**: Delays execution until after a specified inactivity period.
-   **Throttling**: Ensures execution occurs at most once in a given timeframe.

```
<span>function</span> <span>debounce</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>,</span> <span>delay</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>timeout</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return </span><span>(...</span><span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>clearTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>timeout</span><span>);</span>
        <span>timeout</span> <span>=</span> <span>setTimeout</span><span>(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>func</span><span>(...</span><span>args</span><span>),</span> <span>delay</span><span>);</span>
    <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>window</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>resize</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>debounce</span><span>(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Resized!</span><span>'</span><span>),</span> <span>200</span><span>));</span>
```

## [](https://dev.to/hkp22/writing-clean-and-efficient-javascript-10-best-practices-every-developer-should-know-20be?context=digest#5-cache-expensive-calculations-with-memoization)5\. **Cache Expensive Calculations with Memoization**

Memoization is an optimization technique that stores the results of expensive function calls to prevent redundant calculations.  

```
<span>function</span> <span>memoize</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>cache</span> <span>=</span> <span>{};</span>
    <span>return </span><span>(...</span><span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>const</span> <span>key</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
        <span>if </span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>cache</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>])</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>cache</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>func</span><span>(...</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>cache</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>];</span>
    <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>const</span> <span>factorial</span> <span>=</span> <span>memoize</span><span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>1</span> <span>?</span> <span>1</span> <span>:</span> <span>n</span> <span>*</span> <span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>)));</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>));</span> <span>// Output: 120</span>
```

Memoization is particularly effective for computationally intensive tasks.

## [](https://dev.to/hkp22/writing-clean-and-efficient-javascript-10-best-practices-every-developer-should-know-20be?context=digest#6-use-dynamic-imports-for-faster-load-times)6\. **Use Dynamic Imports for Faster Load Times**

Dynamic imports enable you to load JavaScript modules on demand, improving initial load times for large applications.  

```
<span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>loadChart</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>Chart</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>import</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>./chart.js</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>chart</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Chart</span><span>();</span>
    <span>chart</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
```

This technique is especially valuable in single-page applications (SPAs) to manage performance.

## [](https://dev.to/hkp22/writing-clean-and-efficient-javascript-10-best-practices-every-developer-should-know-20be?context=digest#7-write-selfdocumenting-code)7\. **Write Self-Documenting Code**

Readable code reduces the need for excessive comments and makes maintenance easier. Use descriptive variable and function names to convey intent clearly.  

```
<span>// Self-documenting variable names</span>
<span>const</span> <span>totalItemsInCart</span> <span>=</span> <span>items</span><span>.</span><span>reduce</span><span>((</span><span>total</span><span>,</span> <span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>total</span> <span>+</span> <span>item</span><span>.</span><span>quantity</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
```

For complex logic or larger projects, supplement your code with tools like **JSDoc** to generate professional documentation.

## [](https://dev.to/hkp22/writing-clean-and-efficient-javascript-10-best-practices-every-developer-should-know-20be?context=digest#8-write-tests-to-ensure-code-quality)8\. **Write Tests to Ensure Code Quality**

Testing ensures your code works as intended and reduces the risk of bugs. Use unit tests for individual functions and integration tests for interactions between components.  

```
<span>test</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>adds two numbers</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>expect</span><span>(</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)).</span><span>toBe</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>
```

Frameworks like Jest and Mocha simplify the testing process, allowing you to refactor with confidence.

## [](https://dev.to/hkp22/writing-clean-and-efficient-javascript-10-best-practices-every-developer-should-know-20be?context=digest#9-handle-errors-gracefully)9\. **Handle Errors Gracefully**

Proactive error handling ensures your application remains functional, even when something goes wrong. Use `try-catch` blocks for runtime errors and validate inputs to prevent unexpected behavior.  

```
<span>try</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>invalid JSON</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span> <span>catch </span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Failed to parse JSON:</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>.</span><span>message</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
```

Displaying helpful error messages improves both developer experience and user trust.
