# Even Apple wasn’t able to make VR headsets mainstream in 2024 - The Verge

> ## Excerpt
> Glasses seem like the way forward, but Apple might be a long ways away from making them.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset is an incredible piece of technology, but even Apple’s design and marketing magic [hasn’t been enough to](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277584/apple-vision-pro-manufacturing-cutback) convince many people to don a VR headset for an entire day. Instead, people seem more willing to use discreet wearables like Bluetooth headphones, smartwatches, and products like the Ray-Ban Meta glasses — so Apple’s headset isn’t making the waves the company would have wanted.

Of course, an instant transformation of the computing landscape wasn’t exactly the point of the Vision Pro. Apple was clearly launching its headset for Apple enthusiasts, first adopters, and people who love VR. At a starting price of $3,499, the barrier of entry was just too high to expect the device to be a hit from the jump. Even CEO Tim Cook called it [an “early-adopter product.”](https://www.wsj.com/style/tim-cook-interview-apple-intelligence-vision-pro-48c59018)

_Would you really want to wear this all day?_

Nearly a year from launch, though, Apple hasn’t done enough to demonstrate why the Vision Pro should be a potential showcase of the future of computing. It’s taking a long time to put together its immersive content library, and while those are great demonstrations of what’s possible, the videos have been [short and isolating](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24266816/submerged-apple-vision-pro-immersive-film). There aren’t many great games, either.

Yes, Apple keeps adding cool new software features. The [wide and ultra widescreen settings](https://9to5mac.com/2024/11/04/visionos-2-2-adds-new-wide-and-ultrawide-settings-for-mac-virtual-display/) for using a Mac display seem exceptionally useful. But those are pretty specific options for pretty specific use cases. There still isn’t an immediate, obvious reason to buy a Vision Pro the way there usually is with the company’s newest iPhones and Macs. If I bought a Vision Pro today, I wouldn’t know what to do with it besides give myself a bigger Mac screen or watch movies, and I don’t think either of those are worth the exorbitant price.

It seems Apple may have already acknowledged that the Vision Pro might not be the future, either. The company has reportedly scaled back production and focused efforts on [a cheaper version of the headset](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181106/apple-vision-pro-team-cheaper-headset) (perhaps just called Apple Vision?).

If Apple still wants to make a splash in VR, the company might need to race to get its next product out the door. It can be argued that Meta has the best VR headsets and ecosystem on the market right now — and a very clear lineup for consumers to consider. Its most affordable offering is the [$299 Quest 3S](https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3s/?srsltid=AfmBOoq232asvRsVYDw0SVMuWpf961Rw4Jll6D_XQ8hMfIaEpby-UhXI), which has the same chip as the [$499 Quest 3](https://www.theverge.com/23906313/meta-quest-3-review-vr-mixed-reality-headset), meaning you can access the same experiences across both headsets. The price difference between the two largely comes down to displays and storage, and I’d argue that the cheaper Quest 3S is an excellent VR headset for most people.

_The Meta Quest Pro, which launched at $1,499, was a flop._

But like the Vision Pro, Meta hasn’t really found a way to make its headsets much more than a great way to play VR games. The [Quest Pro](https://www.theverge.com/23451629/meta-quest-pro-vr-headset-horizon-review), which Meta pitched in part as a headset for work, was such a flop that the company discontinued it only [two years after it launched](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253322/meta-quest-pro-2-discontinued-vr). [_Horizon Worlds_](https://www.meta.com/experiences/meta-horizon-worlds/2532035600194083/?srsltid=AfmBOoobZhWe3zUnitiyTWprnfOsBc87Ni-feBp0OwxTUAWL0pdBnzxg), the company’s 3D social network, still feels amateur and barren, despite the company’s efforts to make it a better place to hang out.

When I put on a Meta headset, I find that I just want to play games, either serious titles like _Batman: Arkham Shadow_ or lighter fare like _Maestro_, where you conduct a virtual orchestra. I don’t care about the mixed reality features except to glance at my phone or computer screen to make a note or check notifications. You can make a pretty solid living selling game consoles, as Sony and Nintendo know very well, but it’s a far cry from the full-fledged computing platform Mark Zuckerberg once promised.

I just don’t know if any tech company is going to crack the code on how to make VR headsets anything but solo technology. Yes, you can use VR headsets to interact with other people over the internet. But putting on a VR headset at home means I can’t look my wife in the eye; if I’m going to look at a screen, I’d prefer to look at one that we can share or that I can easily put off to the side. And even if you’re fine with VR being mostly a solo thing, VR headsets don’t fit neatly into everyday life unless you have a good amount of space in your home for them. (And hopefully your controllers haven’t run out of battery power!)

_Maybe AR glasses are the way to go._

Perhaps that’s why glasses seem like a much more promising option for computers that you wear on your face. Augmented reality glasses have been an aspirational goal for a long time, and you can see why. It’s much easier to make eye contact with somebody while you’re wearing glasses. Meta may have already proved that the glasses form factor works: its relatively simple [Ray-Ban Meta glasses](https://www.theverge.com/23922425/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review), which have a camera, speakers, and look fashionable, are already [a huge hit](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24276144/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-taking-off-globally).

If glasses-equipped cameras do truly go mainstream, I have some concerns [that I’ve already written about](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/28/24256310/meta-ray-bans-cameras-future-connect). But I also wrote about the immediate appeal of the tech: whenever I wear the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, I find myself snapping tons of photos because it’s so much fun to capture my point of view without holding up a phone. And because they look like regular glasses, I can walk around and most people will think that they’re glasses, unlike a VR headset, [which just looks silly in public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvkgmyfMPks).

It seems that Apple might be eyeing computer glasses as well; the company [reportedly launched](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-04/apple-explores-push-into-smart-glasses-with-atlas-user-study) an internal study about the market. I think even glasses with some basic tech would make _way_ more sense for Apple than a VR headset, especially if they let you easily snap photos and listen to podcasts. These devices could be years off, though, meaning that, right now, Apple is stuck selling VR headsets that [barely anyone wants](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/27/24142810/apple-vision-pro-ebay-low-prices).
