JavaScript's flexibility as a functional programming language allows developers to manipulate functions as first-class objects. Among the advanced topics that emerge from this capability are **function currying** and **partial application**. These techniques not only enhance code readability but also increase reusability, promote functional programming paradigms, and allow for advanced compose strategies within JavaScript applications. This article aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of currying and partial application, delving into their histories, technical facets, nuances, practical applications, and associated pitfalls.

### [](https://dev.to/omriluz1/function-currying-and-partial-application-3jj0?context=digest#what-is-currying)What is Currying?

**Currying** is a mathematical concept originating from the work of Haskell Curry in the 1930s. In computer science, currying refers to transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions, each taking a single argument. The primary purpose of currying is to enable a higher-order functional style where functions can be partially applied.

### [](https://dev.to/omriluz1/function-currying-and-partial-application-3jj0?context=digest#what-is-partial-application)What is Partial Application?

**Partial application**, on the other hand, refers to the process of fixing a number of arguments for a function, producing another function of smaller arity. In practice, it allows a developer to create specialized functions by pre-filling some arguments of a given function.

### [](https://dev.to/omriluz1/function-currying-and-partial-application-3jj0?context=digest#the-difference)The Difference

While both currying and partial application can reduce the number of parameters a function accepts over successive calls, currying strictly transforms a function into unary (single-argument) functions. Partial application transforms a function such that some arguments can be pre-defined.

### [](https://dev.to/omriluz1/function-currying-and-partial-application-3jj0?context=digest#basic-implementation)Basic Implementation

Let’s start with a simple example to clarify the concepts of currying and partial application.

#### [](https://dev.to/omriluz1/function-currying-and-partial-application-3jj0?context=digest#basic-currying-example)Basic Currying Example

```
<span>function</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span><span>;</span>
    <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Usage</span>
<span>const</span> <span>add5</span> <span>=</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>);</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>add5</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>));</span> <span>// Outputs: 15</span>
```

This example demonstrates currying where the `add` function can transform into `add5`, a new function focused on adding `5`.

#### [](https://dev.to/omriluz1/function-currying-and-partial-application-3jj0?context=digest#basic-partial-application-example)Basic Partial Application Example

We can perform partial application using a different approach:  

```
<span>function</span> <span>multiply</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>y</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>partiallyApply</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>,</span> <span>fixedArg</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>function</span><span>(...</span><span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>fixedArg</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
    <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Usage</span>
<span>const</span> <span>double</span> <span>=</span> <span>partiallyApply</span><span>(</span><span>multiply</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>);</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>double</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>));</span> <span>// Outputs: 20</span>
```

In this case, `partiallyApply` allows us to create a `double` function by pre-fixing `2` as an argument for the `multiply` function.

Currying can be extended to handle higher degrees of arity. Here’s a more advanced implementation:  

```
<span>function</span> <span>curry</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>curried</span> <span>=</span> <span>(...</span><span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if </span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>.</span><span>length</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>func</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>func</span><span>(...</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>return </span><span>(...</span><span>next</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>curried</span><span>(...</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>next</span><span>);</span>
    <span>};</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>curried</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Usage</span>
<span>function</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span> <span>+</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>const</span> <span>curriedSum</span> <span>=</span> <span>curry</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span><span>);</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>curriedSum</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)(</span><span>2</span><span>)(</span><span>3</span><span>));</span> <span>// Outputs: 6</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>curriedSum</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)(</span><span>3</span><span>));</span> <span>// Outputs: 6</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>curriedSum</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>));</span> <span>// Outputs: 6</span>
```

#### [](https://dev.to/omriluz1/function-currying-and-partial-application-3jj0?context=digest#function-composition)Function Composition

Currying and partial application fit neatly into strategies like function composition:  

```
<span>const</span> <span>compose</span> <span>=</span> <span>(...</span><span>fns</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    <span>fns</span><span>.</span><span>reduceRight</span><span>((</span><span>acc</span><span>,</span> <span>fn</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>acc</span><span>),</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Using Curried Functions in Compose</span>
<span>const</span> <span>addOne</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>multiplyByTwo</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>addOneThenMultiplyByTwo</span> <span>=</span> <span>compose</span><span>(</span><span>multiplyByTwo</span><span>,</span> <span>addOne</span><span>);</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>addOneThenMultiplyByTwo</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>));</span> <span>// Outputs: 8</span>
```

#### [](https://dev.to/omriluz1/function-currying-and-partial-application-3jj0?context=digest#immutability-and-function-state)Immutability and Function State

When implementing currying and partial application, one must ensure that external state does not affect the behavior of the functions. Always design pure functions.

#### [](https://dev.to/omriluz1/function-currying-and-partial-application-3jj0?context=digest#argument-handling-and-rest-parameters)Argument Handling and Rest Parameters

We can enhance currying to handle various types of input gracefully using rest parameters:  

```
<span>function</span> <span>flexibleCurry</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>function</span> <span>curried</span><span>(...</span><span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if </span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>.</span><span>length</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>fn</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>fn</span><span>(...</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>function</span><span>(...</span><span>next</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>curried</span><span>(...</span><span>args</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span><span>next</span><span>));</span>
        <span>};</span>
    <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
```

### [](https://dev.to/omriluz1/function-currying-and-partial-application-3jj0?context=digest#function-calls-and-performance)Function Calls and Performance

One of the performance concerns with currying is the potential for many nested function calls, especially when graphically depicted as trees. Despite this, with JavaScript engines optimizing tail calls, the impact is often mitigated. As a best practice, ensure that arity is constrained before creating currying wrappers.

### [](https://dev.to/omriluz1/function-currying-and-partial-application-3jj0?context=digest#lazy-evaluation)Lazy Evaluation

For performance optimizations, implement lazy evaluation principles. By delaying the execution of functions until necessary, we can improve responsiveness in resource-heavy applications. Libraries such as lodash provide out-of-the-box currying functions that document performance benchmarks against hand-rolled methods.

### [](https://dev.to/omriluz1/function-currying-and-partial-application-3jj0?context=digest#memoization)Memoization

In contexts where function invocations are expensive, integrating memoization techniques with currying can significantly enhance performance. This allows caching results of function calls to avoid redundant calculations.  

```
<span>function</span> <span>memoize</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>cache</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Map</span><span>();</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>function </span><span>(...</span><span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>const</span> <span>key</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
        <span>if </span><span>(</span><span>cache</span><span>.</span><span>has</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>cache</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>fn</span><span>(...</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
        <span>cache</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>result</span><span>);</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
    <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>const</span> <span>memoizedSum</span> <span>=</span> <span>memoize</span><span>(</span><span>curriedSum</span><span>);</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>memoizedSum</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)(</span><span>2</span><span>)(</span><span>3</span><span>));</span> <span>// Outputs: First calculation</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>memoizedSum</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)(</span><span>2</span><span>)(</span><span>3</span><span>));</span> <span>// Fetches from cache</span>
