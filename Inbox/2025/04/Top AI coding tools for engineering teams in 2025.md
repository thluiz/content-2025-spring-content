Do you know what‚Äôs actually holding you back from shipping faster?

If you don‚Äôt have data-informed answers to questions about your delivery pace, you‚Äôre never going to improve. But when getting data is a slog and you lack clear metrics, it becomes hard to understand what‚Äôs going on.

Let‚Äôs get back to this week‚Äôs thought.

## Intro

There are many different options for using AI, both personally and professionally. It feels like every single week, a new tool is available, an LLM update is released, or something new shifts how we use AI.

It can feel daunting when choosing which tool to go for and to help us with this, I am happy to bring in [Jeff Morhous](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffery-morhous/) as a guest author to today‚Äôs newsletter article.

Jeff is a Senior Software Engineer and a big AI enthusiast. He is also writing a newsletter called

, where he regularly shares his insights on different AI-related topics.

Today, he is sharing his overview of the top AI coding tools he recommends for engineering teams, his opinion of them, the associated risks and how they can potentially be mitigated.

Let‚Äôs get straight into it!

Jeff, over to you.

## AI tools are no longer (just) toys. They're power tools

Used well, they can help your team ship faster. Used poorly (or not at all), they become a liability.

Rolling out AI at work isn‚Äôt as simple as telling your developers to ‚Äúgo use ChatGPT.‚Äù There are privacy implications, licensing questions, and a rapidly shifting landscape of tools that do everything from autocomplete to autonomous refactoring. Some tools are great for individuals, while others are built for teams.

This guide walks through the major AI tools your engineers are likely to reach for and shows you some of the enterprise-friendly options you can choose from + risks associated with them. Let‚Äôs get into it!

## So what AI tools are worth using?

If you aren‚Äôt already using some AI tools in your day-to-day work, you probably have at least heard some names. Of course, everyone knows ChatGPT, and many are familiar with Copilot, but there are plenty more to get into. Let‚Äôs take a look at each one.

## ChatGPT

ChatGPT is easily the world‚Äôs most popular AI product.

[

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1899d23-ef2c-4808-89dc-777e5b47e443_1600x1020.png)

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1899d23-ef2c-4808-89dc-777e5b47e443_1600x1020.png)

I like ChatGPT because of how great a _product_ it is, even if the underlying model isn‚Äôt always the best choice. With a Plus subscription, you have access to GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, and more models that are on the bleeding edge.

You also get [Deep Research](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/), which in my opinion is the single most useful AI feature on the planet. If you don‚Äôt have time to wait for Deep Research, the Search function is still quite useful.

Combine this with near-infinite chat history, context windows, and custom instructions, and you have a recipe for an incredibly useful product. [Using ‚Äúprojects‚Äù to organize chats, files, and instructions](https://www.augmentedswe.com/p/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-chatgpt) is another great way to get extra use out of the tool.

### ChatGPT for work

**The free version** of ChatGPT gives you access to some basic models. It‚Äôs fast, decent for casual use, and works fine for things like writing boilerplate, summarizing documents, or basic coding help. But it‚Äôs also missing a lot:

-   No access to GPT-4 (or GPT-4o)
    
-   No file uploads, vision, or advanced tools
    
-   No data privacy guarantees
    

**ChatGPT Plus** gives you access to GPT-4o and other top-tier models, including the latest reasoning models. It also has much higher tiers for Deep Research. For $20/month per user, you unlock:

-   Better models
    
-   Tools like Deep Research
    
-   Custom instructions and longer context windows
    
-   [Projects to organize chats, files, and settings per use case](https://www.augmentedswe.com/p/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-chatgpt)
    

It‚Äôs a huge step up from the free tier, and it‚Äôs what I use for personal stuff. It is still a _consumer product_. Your data isn‚Äôt used for training, but there are not a lot of guarantees or guardrails.

**ChatGPT Teams** is for small companies or departments who want more control. It includes everything in Plus and then some:

-   A shared workspace for managing usage and billing
    
-   Data privacy
    
-   Admin controls and some usage analytics
    
-   Higher usage limits
    

This tier starts at $25/user/month, and it‚Äôs a great middle ground if you‚Äôre not ready for Enterprise but want something with better data privacy than Plus.

Meanwhile, **ChatGPT Enterprise** is the full-blown ‚ÄúAI at work‚Äù option. You get:

-   Even longer context windows (128k+ tokens)
    
-   Full SOC 2 compliance, SSO, and audit logging
    
-   Dedicated support and deployment help
    
-   SLA-backed uptime and security guarantees
    

The big draw for businesses here is data privacy and compliance. Nothing your team sends into ChatGPT Enterprise leaves the walled garden. It‚Äôs isolated, encrypted, and never used for training.

If you‚Äôve not been able to get your team's approval to have subscriptions individually expensed, this is probably the next stop.

## Claude

[Claude](https://claude.ai/) is the other big player on the AI-chat block. It‚Äôs a web-based AI tool that has a familiar chat interface but is backed by some truly bleeding-edge models.

[

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca3b389f-50d9-474c-877a-d822481006c6_1600x1020.png)

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca3b389f-50d9-474c-877a-d822481006c6_1600x1020.png)

Anthropic has done an incredible job with the Claude models, but I‚Äôm a little less impressed with the product. It‚Äôs hard to explain exactly why, but I (and plenty of others) have a preference for ChatGPT. Still, Claude, specifically 3.7 Sonnet has consistently better performance _at coding_ than most of OpenAI‚Äôs models.

I can‚Äôt say whether ChatGPT or Claude is objectively better - I‚Äôd bet you find your team mostly split.

### Claude for work

**Claude Pro** costs $20/month and gives you more usage, more models, and more features (like projects!). There‚Äôs even a $100/month tier with _even higher_ caps.

Still, this is a consumer-grade product. Like ChatGPT Plus, it‚Äôs powerful, but not likely a great fit for enterprise work unless you're willing to accept some risk.

**Claude Team** is Anthropic‚Äôs business-tier product for smaller companies. This is the tier most companies should look at if they‚Äôre using Claude seriously. The high token limit is especially valuable for working with codebases, logs, or long-form technical documents.

**Claude Enterprise** offers similar data protections and features to ChatGPT Enterprise, and is a better fit for bigger companies or those subject to heavy data regulations.

## Copilot

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) pioneered the AI-in-the-editor tool category. When Copilot came out, I was genuinely shocked.

[

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c50ebfd-43a8-4059-9e6e-938b16669965_1600x1020.png)

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c50ebfd-43a8-4059-9e6e-938b16669965_1600x1020.png)

As a simple VS code (or your editor of choice) extension, Copilot started as just fancy autocomplete, but has evolved with more features such as Chat, Copilot Edits, and Agent, all of which _help you get more work done in less time._

Though Copilot was the first to the space, competitors such as Cursor and Windsurf have mostly eaten its lunch. Most developers have a preference for one of those tools over Copilot.

### CoPilot for work

[

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd19c400b-659a-4788-a4be-a449f228622a_1600x1020.png)

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd19c400b-659a-4788-a4be-a449f228622a_1600x1020.png)

**Copilot Business** is $19/user/month and is aimed at companies that want to roll it out at scale but have control over usage and data. It includes:

-   Unlimited agent mode and chats with GPT-4o
    
-   Unlimited code completions
    
-   Access to code review, Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet, o1, and more
    
-   300 premium requests to use the latest models per user, with the option to buy more
    
-   User management and usage metrics
    
-   IP indemnity and data privacy
    

This plan addresses the biggest concern most companies have: sending proprietary code to Microsoft. With Copilot Business, code stays private, and Microsoft guarantees it won't be used to improve the model.

Copilot also has an enterprise tier here that comes with even higher limits.

It‚Äôs worth saying that I‚Äôve used Copilot extensively and found it much less useful than Cursor or Windsurf, even with the recent rollout of [agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode).

## Cursor

[Cursor is my favorite AI tool](https://www.augmentedswe.com/t/cursor) right now. It‚Äôs an IDE rather than a code extension, and it‚Äôs everything GitHub Copilot should‚Äôve been.

[

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e26d36b-ffcf-4268-89ab-47440795ef84_1600x1020.png)

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e26d36b-ffcf-4268-89ab-47440795ef84_1600x1020.png)

The Cursor team forked VS code and baked AI into every piece. Here are some highlights:

-   AI-autocomplete as you‚Äôre typing
    
-   Highlight sections of code and ask questions or make alterations
    
-   An agent that will autonomously make changes across your entire codebase
    
-   AI-generated commit messages
    

It _feels_ like VS code, but superpowered. If you haven‚Äôt tried it, I recommend checking it out for at least an hour. Do yourself a favor and go straight to agent mode while trying to write as little actual code as possible.

### Cursor for work

While Copilot tries to layer AI into your editor, Cursor _is_ the editor. And for many engineers (myself included), it's the first tool that feels like a true pair programmer rather than just a code autocomplete engine.

Cursor also offers a **Business** product, which includes:

-   Enforce privacy mode org-wide
    
-   Centralized team billing
    
-   Admin dashboard with usage stats
    
-   SAML/OIDC SSO
    

This tier makes it easy to standardize Cursor across your engineering org while keeping control of how it‚Äôs used and where your data goes.

## Windsurf

[Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/editor) is probably Cursor‚Äôs closest competition. It‚Äôs another standalone IDE, and the developers that love it say they love it because it‚Äôs easier to stay in a focused state of work, almost like pair programming with the editor.

[

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdccebf1-a287-4c51-88b3-3944f25c6c9f_1600x1020.png)

### Windsurf for work

Windsurf also has an **[Enterprise tier](https://windsurf.com/enterprise)** that offers some features and privacy guarantees that make it an easier integration.

There‚Äôs a huge emphasis on legal compliance and privacy that makes Windsurf stand out from the other IDE-based AI tools.

## What are the risks associated with AI coding tools?

The tools mentioned above give every engineer a superpowers, but these superpowers come with risks.

While tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, and Copilot can help you move faster and write better code, they also open the door to new kinds of mistakes, liabilities, and misunderstandings.

Not really a problem if you‚Äôre [vibe coding](https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/is-vibe-coding-the-future-of-software) at home, but businesses care a lot about these risks.

If you're giving your team access to these tools, it‚Äôs worth understanding the major risks so you can make smart, informed decisions.

### Intellectual property and code ownership

One of the most common concerns with these tools is about _who owns the code_ AI helps you write.

If you prompt a model with ‚Äúwrite me a Stripe integration,‚Äù and it spits out something that looks very similar to Stripe‚Äôs open-source SDK, is that your code now? What if it lifted that snippet from a repository with a non-permissive license?

There‚Äôs no real conclusion here yet.

AI models are trained on massive amounts of data, some open-source, some not. While the major players have legal teams arguing that the output is transformative and doesn‚Äôt constitute copying, it still (rightfully) makes many legal teams a little nervous.

Windsurf for example mitigates this with guarantees about where they get their training data.

### Intellectual property leakage

The flip side of ownership is leakage. If your engineers paste sensitive code into ChatGPT or Claude, you‚Äôve just handed it to another company.

Personally, I‚Äôm not concerned about this sort of risk, because **that risk already applies to traditional search tools**. Knowing not to leak proprietary data to Google carries over to LLM web tools.

It‚Äôs a harder problem to solve with editor-based tools like Copilot, Cursor, and Windsurf, which is why many companies are banning those tools entirely.

Sure, this works, but each tool has an enterprise tier that attempts to address some of these concerns, and you may decide the tradeoffs are worth it.

### Engineers taking output at face value

The last big risk is the easiest to overlook and the hardest to fix: overconfidence.

AI-generated code looks confident, but it can still be wrong.

Less observant engineers may be prone to assume the output is ‚Äúprobably correct‚Äù just because it came from a confident model output.

But these tools don‚Äôt _know_ things the way humans do, and I‚Äôm still not convinced they can actually reason. Sometimes they guess right, sometimes not. You still need engineers who can read, understand, and take responsibility for the code.

The fix here is cultural, not technical. Make it clear that AI is a tool, not a teammate. Every line of code it writes is your code now.

## Taking responsibility for AI-augmented work

**Computers can‚Äôt be held accountable**. These tools are powerful, but as of now, they just predict the next best token. The responsibility for every line of code still falls squarely on human engineers, reviewers, and decision-makers.

> There‚Äôs no way to fully eliminate the risks of using AI tools, but avoiding them altogether comes with its own risk: falling behind.

Teams that augment themselves with AI are moving faster, exploring more ideas, and automating the boring stuff.

Every business will have to decide where it draws the line. But if you're going to encourage your engineers to use AI at work, make it clear that the outputs are suggestions, not decisions.

They still need human eyes, human judgment, and human accountability.
