“Treat yourself like someone you love” As someone who has struggled with self hatred for a large majority of my life, this is such an important reframe.

1\. Somatic check multiple times through day 2. Interact with nature. Small walks. 3. Forgive yourself for failure. Extend compassion to yourself which you have for the rest of the beings on this planet. 4. 2 minute tidy your room 5. Practice gratitude. Be thankful you are able to exist right now. Gratitude journal and sending thank you messages.

5 Micro Habits 1. Somatic Pause Body Scan: Pause and check in internally, manual (less than 1 min) 2. Micro Nature Breaks 3. Checking in ourselves whether we are giving ourselves the love and kindness in our lives? "I can choose to take this as a lesson and i am human" Izzy. 4. 2 min tidy (physical clutter can overload mental clutter) 5. Cultivate gratitude on daily basis. (Improve mood, mental fitness and physical health). (Gratitude journal, gratitude messaging). 2 action points you are going to take away from this for your own life? Somatic pauses, love and kindness. Maybe it can change or there can be more.

"a way of BEING, not a way of buying" <3

i love how you emphasized to not only watch videos for entertainment purposes but also to learn something from them cuz im literally like this where i keep on watching these self improvements videos but forget to implement them in real time.

I work in healthcare. 2 things I'll be bringing forth from now on. Somatic pauses and being more compassionate towards myself. The other 3 are already daily practices. Thank you for the reminders !

isnt it interesting how being outdoors is so profoundly helpful for body and mind but we have built a society that keeps us indoors most of the time.

Somatic pause, self compassion and 2 min tidy are habits I need to include in my daily life right now!

Your video came up on my YouTube feed. I appreciate your candid sharing of emotions- that you did not edit out the moment when your eyes started to tear up talking about self love. May more younger healthcare professionals integrate your approach with their patients. Thank you.

I have decided that I'm gonna prepare a compassion jar where I'll just write small quotes of compassion and positivity on a piece of paper and put it in that jar. One day when I feel low or overwhelmed I'll just pick up a paper from that and read it.

The truth that I love and forgive my pet more than myself just made me so emotional. The urge to be perfect and to punish myself mental if not, is really a habit I should get rid of. Thank you.

Thank you for being such a genuine person . I felt so connected to you when you talked about self compassion . I also tend to get emotional often when i think about how much i make myself suffer just because of my thoughts ,insecurities and comparing myself to others . At the end of the day i only have myself so why not give myself the love and care i deserve!

Hi Izzy! I felt so connected with you when you were talking about self-compassion. I am also a doctor and I am 6 months pregnant. Working, studying, and creating a family are my life and I try to be as productive as I can. Very often I forget that is normal to get tired because of pregnancy that is ok to exercise a couple of days a week only, and that it is ok not to know every detail of the book. I will definitely cultivate more self-compassion. Thank you for such a beautiful and uplifting video. Blessings to you and your lovely family!

Wow! That’s the first wellness video from a content creator that actually makes sense! I have no idea how some people can live with themselves, selling an unattainable paradise to their viewers. Great job girl!

Saw a short video the other day, “think about 3 people you love right now”, how many of us can put ourselves on the list? Growing up in Asia, I was submerged with a lot of twisted education or voices of put oneself first is selfish, you’re worthy only when you’re perfect and make everyone proud. Hopefully by realizing how much that hurt ourselves can prevent it for the next generations.

Pretty sure I’d never seen your videos until this popped into my feed. Love it. Shared with my husband and am going to try integrating all of these, but starting with 2 action items of keeping the gratitude journaling in my planner (then I can’t lose it) and somatic pauses (which has already been pushed by my physical therapist but multiple sources always make it easier to remember). Thank you so much and I’m excited to see more of your channel going forward.

The best part is that all of these combined will only take Conscious 30 mins of your whole day!! I’ll inculcate 2 mins tidy, self forgiveness and nature breaks bed time gratitude

It's odd about kindness. When I am feeling vulnerable and someone treats me with kindness, it completely unglues me. It's a lovely thing, but also baffling. Why does kindness make us deeply emotional in response? Odd.
