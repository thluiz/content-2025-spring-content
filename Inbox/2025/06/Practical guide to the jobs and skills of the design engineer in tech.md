Design engineering textbooks from the 2010s, focused on the intersection of mechanical engineering and industrial product design

For decades, design engineering referred to the intersection of industrial product design and mechanical engineering.

Now, in tech, design engineering refers to the union of visual design and software development, and it’s one of the current things — In 2024, more than 10 thought leaders in the industry created discourse on design engineering with essays and educational material. (Links at the end.)

This popularity of design engineering in tech is a result of macro developments in the last 5–10 years, like the following:

-   Hardware — It’s now feasible to run impressive visuals and motion on the average computer.
    
-   Developer tools — With new web standards and the likes of [Figma](https://figma.com/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailwind_CSS), [Vercel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vercel), and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), design-focused developers achieve much more than before.
    
-   Economics — Software is now a commodity, where [design is a competitive differentiator](https://www.designdisciplin.com/p/the-creative-director-in-the-age).
    

As a result, my inbox is full of young people asking how to learn design engineering and get jobs. To set you up for success, I’ll throw light on 2 questions:

1.  What are actually the jobs that design engineers do in tech, day-to-day?
    
2.  How can you learn to do these jobs?

## What Even Is a Design Engineer?

A design engineer is an engineer with design skills, so that:

-   They don’t need designers designing what to build — they can take inputs that designers take and deliver the outputs that engineers deliver.
    
-   When working with designers, they communicate very efficiently and make contributions to design work.
    
-   They build with production-grade materials (e.g. code) for design decisions that can’t be experienced on any other material (e.g. interactions).
    
-   They build tools to make designing easier, better, faster, and to design things that could not be designed before.
    

Doing these things today requires extensive skills in both design and engineering. There are very few educational programs and resources that specifically teach software design engineering. Most software design engineers learn by dual-classing: separately learning design and software engineering.

In the future, I expect books, courses, and other resources will emerge to specifically and efficiently teach this discipline — just like we have for industrial design engineering. Right now, software design engineering is a unique opportunity for creative self-learners.

## What Do Design Engineers Do?

Despite the new technological capabilities that resulted in its popularity, design engineering in tech is not a new job — it’s simply a re-configuration of the jobs that designers and engineers have been doing for years.

Here are 4 kinds of things that design engineers work on in tech:

Stripe’s website has hundreds, if not thousands, of pages

### **Marketing**

Design engineers on marketing teams build impressive websites and make their company look attractive on the internet.

One reason why marketing hires design engineers is when the website is large and feature-rich — beyond what makes sense to do with website builders like Framer or Webflow. Large companies like [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) have this need. This work requires strength in traditional front-end and full-stack development skills. With higher budgets, these projects also call for [impressive animations](https://animations.dev/) and creative graphics while retaining accessibility.

Marketing websites might also involve rich animations, 3D, and game-like experiences. Also known as “creative development”, [Unseen Studio](https://unseen.co/)’s work is a great example in this category. This kind of work requires advanced skills around HTML/CSS, 3D graphics, motion design, typography… These devs often push innovation on immersive design and interactivity, at the expense of conventional accessibility.

[Fey](https://www.fey.com/refer/mehmet) is a financial tracker known for its high-quality product design

### **Product**

There are two focus areas for product design engineering:

1.  “Polish” of the user interface – motion and interactivity – which is challenging to hand off from design to engineering.
    
2.  Design systems, which accelerate design, and facilitate the design to engineering handoff.
    

The scope of shipping a product involves user research, backend engineering, test-driven frontend development… So, this role is highly collaborative — [this job posting from GitHub](https://globalcareers-githubinc.icims.com/jobs/3298/senior-design-engineer/job?mode=view&mobile=false&width=1250&height=500&bga=true&needsRedirect=false&jan1offset=-480&jun1offset=-420) lists “product design, design systems, design ops, front-end development, and illustration” as the talents that span the team. The design engineer speaks all of those languages.

Product design engineers do whatever it takes to steward product quality — a mix of front-end development, graphics, UX, UI, and motion design skills, in a way that plays with others on the team.

### **R&D**

R&D design engineers build prototypes of new things, to visualize and test new products in the real world.

This kind of design engineering has been around for much longer than roles focused on websites and product interfaces. However, these jobs are rare, found at larger and economically stable companies — see [Ivan Poupyrev’s work at Google](http://www.ivanpoupyrev.com/), and [Jordan Singer](https://x.com/jsngr)’s Figma-funded innovations.

Worth knowing, from a job market perspective: At the first signs of distress, R&D is the first to get canceled at even the most stable companies — see [Ikea’s innovative Space10 lab](https://www.dezeen.com/2023/08/29/space10-to-close-ikea-innovation-lab/), which closed doors last year.

In R&D, you constantly learn new skill trees. I’ve done 10 years of R&D and learned the Python, Lua, C#, MATLAB, Unity, JavaScript, Arduino, and Processing platforms, as well as electronics, robotics, physical fabrication, and photography. It’s the Wild West — you have to draw quickly.

### Founding

The founding design engineer can execute UX, growth, and brand identity design as well as product-building — life-altering combination for [solopreneurs](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/solopreneur) and small early-stage teams.

Arguably, all of the internet-famous software solopreneurs like [Pieter Levels](https://x.com/levelsio), [Danny Postma](https://x.com/dannypostmaa), and [Marc Louvion](https://x.com/marc_louvion) are design engineers: They not only build but also publish themselves, taking care of UX design and marketing as well as their core engineering work.

I have been selling [this skillset as a service to early-stage founders](https://www.baytas.net/services) since early 2023, and done some of the most valuable work in my life. Of course, there are downsides: early-stage ventures have massive economic uncertainty, and demand extreme breadth of skills across business, design, marketing and engineering.

## How to Learn Design Engineering

As said above, we don’t have many resources today that specifically teach software design engineering. However, if you have an existing foundation in design or engineering, there are resources tailored to help you dual-class.

For designers, here are my favorites:

-   [Harvard’s CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) – one of the top online courses in the world – teaches computer science and programming from the ground up
    
-   [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) are free resources that teach web development, highly acclaimed by professionals
    
-   The [UI Engineering 101 for Designers](https://maven.com/s/course/8e17a3cb04) course by veterans [Mariana Castilho](https://x.com/mrncst) and [Derek Briggs](https://x.com/PixelJanitor). goes for “polish” in frontend
    
-   [Scrimba](https://v2.scrimba.com/?via=dd) is the most innovative online coding school, for all levels
    

For developers:

-   [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/) is one of the most efficient textbooks on interface design
    
-   Ellen Lupton’s [Thinking with Type](https://geni.us/thinking-with-type-dd) demystifies typography and layout theory
    
-   [Awwwards Academy](https://www.awwwards.com/academy/) offers courses on visual design and creative skills taught by seasoned professionals
    
-   [Animations on the Web](https://animations.dev/) is a cutting-edge course by [Emil Kowalski](https://x.com/emilkowalski_)
    

And once you feel ready for the challenge, the job board at [designengineer.io](https://designengineer.io/) is an excellent place to start looking.

Tech moves very fast. Some of you might be already working on textbooks, courses, and other resources that specifically and efficiently teach interface design engineering. If that’s you, please [reach out and say hi](https://x.com/doctorbaytas).
