## F# Interview Questions for Developers

Use our engineer-created questions to interview and hire the most qualified F# developers for your organization.

[Back to interview questions](https://coderpad.io/interview-questions/)

F# has gained popularity in recent years due to its unique combination of functional programming and object-oriented programming features, its concise and expressive syntax, and its integration with the .NET ecosystem.

> F# was created by Don Syme at Microsoft Research in the early 2000s. It was initially designed as a .NET-compatible functional programming language with the goal of simplifying complex programming tasks and improving developer productivity. F# has since evolved into a general-purpose language and is now part of the .NET ecosystem.

In order to evaluate the expertise of F# developers during programming interviews, we provide a collection of hands-on coding exercises and interview questions outlined below. Additionally, we have developed a range of suggested methods to ensure that your interview inquiries accurately measure the candidates’ F# capabilities.

## **F#** **example question**

### Help us design a parking lot app

Hey candidate! Welcome to your interview. Boilerplate is provided. Feel free to change the code as you see fit. To run the code at any time, please hit the run button located in the top left corner.

Goals: Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles

**Here are a few methods that you should be able to run:**

-   Tell us how many spots are remaining
-   Tell us how many total spots are in the parking lot
-   Tell us when the parking lot is full
-   Tell us when the parking lot is empty
-   Tell us when certain spots are full e.g. when all motorcycle spots are taken
-   Tell us how many spots vans are taking up

**Assumptions:**

-   The parking lot can hold motorcycles, cars and vans
-   The parking lot has motorcycle spots, car spots and large spots
-   A motorcycle can park in any spot
-   A car can park in a single compact spot, or a regular spot
-   A van can park, but it will take up 3 regular spots
-   These are just a few assumptions. Feel free to ask your interviewer about more assumptions as needed

## Junior F# interview questions

**Question: How can you define a record type in F#?  
Answer:** In F#, a record type is defined using the `type` keyword followed by the record name and a set of fields enclosed in curly braces. For example:

```
<span><code>type Person = { Name: string; Age: int }</code></span>
```

**Question: What is pattern matching in F# and how is it used?  
Answer:** Pattern matching is a powerful feature in F# that allows you to match the structure of data and perform different actions based on the patterns. It is often used with the `match` keyword. For example:

```
<span><code id="code-lang-javascript"><span>let</span> rec factorial n =
    match n <span>with</span>
    | <span>0</span> -&gt; <span>1</span>
    | _ -&gt; n * factorial (n - <span>1</span>)</code></span><small id="shcb-language-1"><span>Code language:</span> <span>JavaScript</span> <span>(</span><span>javascript</span><span>)</span></small>
```

**Question: How can you define an immutable list in F#?  
Answer:** In F#, an immutable list can be defined using square brackets and semicolons to separate the elements. For example:

```
<span><code id="code-lang-javascript"><span>let</span> myList = [<span>1</span>; <span>2</span>; <span>3</span>]</code></span><small id="shcb-language-2"><span>Code language:</span> <span>JavaScript</span> <span>(</span><span>javascript</span><span>)</span></small>
```

**Question: What is the purpose of the `async` keyword in F#?  
Answer:** The `async` keyword is used in F# to define asynchronous computations. It allows you to write code that can perform I/O or long-running operations without blocking the execution. The result of an asynchronous computation is typically represented by the `Async<'T>` type. Here’s an example:

```
<span><code id="code-lang-javascript"><span>let</span> asyncExample = <span>async</span> {
    <span>// Asynchronous code here</span>
}</code></span><small id="shcb-language-3"><span>Code language:</span> <span>JavaScript</span> <span>(</span><span>javascript</span><span>)</span></small>
```

**Question: How can you handle exceptions in F#?  
Answer:** Exceptions in F# can be handled using the `try/with` expression. The code that may raise an exception is enclosed in the `try` block, and specific exception handlers are defined in the `with` block. For example:

```
<span><code id="code-lang-javascript"><span>try</span>
    <span>// Code that may raise an exception</span>
<span>with</span>
    | ex -&gt; printfn <span>"An exception occurred: %s"</span> ex.Message</code></span><small id="shcb-language-4"><span>Code language:</span> <span>JavaScript</span> <span>(</span><span>javascript</span><span>)</span></small>
```

**Question: What is currying in F# and how is it useful?  
Answer:** Currying in F# is the technique of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This allows partial application of functions and makes it easier to create specialized versions of functions. Here’s an example:

```
<span><code id="code-lang-javascript"><span>let</span> add x y = x + y
<span>let</span> addCurried = add <span>5</span></code></span><small id="shcb-language-5"><span>Code language:</span> <span>JavaScript</span> <span>(</span><span>javascript</span><span>)</span></small>
```

**Question: How do you define a discriminated union type in F#?  
Answer:** In F#, a discriminated union type is defined using the `type` keyword followed by the union name and a set of cases separated by the pipe `|` symbol. Each case can optionally have associated data. For example:

```
<span><code>type Shape =
    | Circle of float
    | Rectangle of float * float</code></span>
```

**Question: How can you define a recursive function in F#?  
Answer:** In F#, a recursive function is defined using the `let rec` keyword instead of just `let`. This allows the function to refer to itself within its body. For example:

```
<span><code id="code-lang-javascript"><span>let</span> rec factorial n =
    <span>if</span> n &lt;= <span>1</span> then <span>1</span>
    <span>else</span> n * factorial (n - <span>1</span>)</code></span><small id="shcb-language-6"><span>Code language:</span> <span>JavaScript</span> <span>(</span><span>javascript</span><span>)</span></small>
```

**Question: How do you define an option type in F#?  
Answer:** In F#, the option type is defined using the `Option<'T>` generic type. It represents a value that can either be `Some` value of type `'T` or `None`. For example:

```
<span><code id="code-lang-xml">let optionalValue : Option<span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt;</span> = Some 42</code></span><small id="shcb-language-7"><span>Code language:</span> <span>HTML, XML</span> <span>(</span><span>xml</span><span>)</span></small>
```

**Question: What is partial function application in F# and how is it achieved?  
**Answer: Partial function application in F# allows you to create a new function by supplying some, but not all, of the arguments to an existing function. This can be achieved using the `_` (underscore) placeholder for the arguments you want to partially apply. For example:

```
<span><code id="code-lang-javascript"><span>let</span> multiply x y = x * y
<span>let</span> double = multiply <span>2</span></code></span><small id="shcb-language-8"><span>Code language:</span> <span>JavaScript</span> <span>(</span><span>javascript</span><span>)</span></small>
```

In the above code, `multiply` is a function that takes two arguments. By applying `2` to `multiply`, we create a new function `double` that multiplies its argument by `2`.

**Question: How can you define a higher-order function in F#?  
Answer:**

```
<span><code id="code-lang-javascript"><span>let</span> applyTwice f x = f (f x)</code></span><small id="shcb-language-9"><span>Code language:</span> <span>JavaScript</span> <span>(</span><span>javascript</span><span>)</span></small>
```

**Question: What are the benefits of using immutability in F#?  
Answer:** Immutable data promotes a functional programming style and offers benefits such as improved code clarity, better testability, easier concurrency and parallelism, and fewer bugs related to shared mutable state.

**Question: How can you handle asynchronous operations in F#?  
Answer:**

```
<span><code id="code-lang-javascript"><span>let</span> asyncOperation = <span>async</span> {
    <span>// Asynchronous code here</span>
    <span>return</span> result
}
<span>let</span> result = Async.RunSynchronously asyncOperation</code></span><small id="shcb-language-10"><span>Code language:</span> <span>JavaScript</span> <span>(</span><span>javascript</span><span>)</span></small>
```

**Question: What is the purpose of the `Seq` module in F#?  
Answer:** The `Seq` module provides functions for working with sequences (lazy lists) in F#. It offers operations like mapping, filtering, folding, and more. It enables efficient processing of large or infinite sequences.

**Question: How can you implement memoization in F#?  
Answer:**

```
<span><code id="code-lang-javascript"><span>let</span> memoize f =
    <span>let</span> cache = System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary&lt;_, _&gt;()
    fun x -&gt;
        <span>if</span> cache.ContainsKey(x) then
            cache.[x]
        <span>else</span>
            <span>let</span> result = f x
            cache.[x] &lt;- result
            result</code></span><small id="shcb-language-11"><span>Code language:</span> <span>JavaScript</span> <span>(</span><span>javascript</span><span>)</span></small>
```

**Question: How do you define an interface in F#?  
Answer:**

```
<span><code id="code-lang-php">type IShape =
    <span>abstract</span> member Area : float
    <span>abstract</span> member Perimeter : float</code></span><small id="shcb-language-12"><span>Code language:</span> <span>PHP</span> <span>(</span><span>php</span><span>)</span></small>
```

**Question: How can you use F# computation expressions to work with custom types?  
Answer:** F# computation expressions, also known as workflows, allow you to define custom control flow for your types. By implementing specific computation builders, you can define specialized syntax and behavior for your types, making them easier to work with in specific domains.

**Question:** What is tail recursion optimization, and why is it important in functional programming?  
**Answer:** Tail recursion optimization is a compiler optimization technique that eliminates unnecessary stack frames in recursive function calls. It prevents stack overflow errors and improves the performance of recursive functions, making them more efficient in functional programming where recursion is often used instead of loops.

**Question: How can you write unit tests for F# code?  
Answer:** F# supports various unit testing frameworks such as NUnit, xUnit, and FsUnit. You can write test cases using frameworks like these, creating test functions that exercise your code and assert the expected behavior.

**Question**: **How can you handle errors and propagate them in a functional way in F#?  
Answer**: In F#, you can handle errors using the `Result<'T, 'Error>` type or the `Option<'T>` type. You can propagate errors using match expressions or functions like `Result.map`, `Result.bind`, `Option.map`, and `Option.bind`. This functional error handling approach helps ensure code correctness and enables composability.
