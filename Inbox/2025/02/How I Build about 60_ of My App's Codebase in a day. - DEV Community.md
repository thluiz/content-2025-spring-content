One of the standout features of The Coders Bakery is its code generation capabilities. Within minutes, the platform had generated around 60% of my app's codebase. This included:

-   Authentication Module: Complete with user registration, login, and password recovery functionalities.
-   Database Integration: Pre-configured models and ORM setup for seamless database operations.

By using The Coders Bakery, I was able to save a significant amount of time and effort. Tasks that would have taken days or even weeks were completed in a matter of minutes.

I wanted to build a Restaurant Rating App in which users can rate the dishes of the restaurant and it will generate the rating of the restaurant. I needed an admin panel from where admin can add restaurant and dishes and monitor user’s ratings. So i needed an admin panel, user facing UIs, obviously whole User authentication and authorization and Email services for notification. I wanted the functionality where users can comment on dishes improvement and likes, dislikes.

So First thing i did was list down all Entities I will need in my app:

-   User
-   Restaurant
-   Dish
-   Ingredient
-   Rating
-   Comment

Now picking up each entity, i added all properties i need in each entity, like:

Then i put all these details in the Dashboard and creating relation between entities was super simple. Then by just one click, the whole codebase was ready to be used.
