### Things I've changed my mind on:

Things I now believe, which past me would've squabbled with:

-   Simple is not given. It takes constant work
-   There is no pride in managing or understanding complexity
-   Typed languages are essential on teams with mixed experience levels
-   Java is a great language _because_ it's boring
-   REPLs are not useful design tools (though, they _are_ useful exploratory tools)
-   Most programming should be done long before a single line of code is written
-   Frontend development is a nightmare world of Kafkaesque awfulness I no longer enjoy
-   Elegance is not a real metric
-   Good management is _invaluable_. (I went most of my career before seeing it done well)
-   DynamoDB is a good database (**IFF** your workload lines up with what it's offering)
-   Objects are extremely good at what they're good at. Blind devotion to functional is dumb.

### Opinions I've picked up along the way

-   Engineering is mostly about communication
-   Never go full monad in Java.
-   The query planner is a [cruel mistress](https://chriskiehl.com/article/query-plan-management)
-   If I think something is easy, that's a sure sign I don't understand it.
-   You have to give younger devs room to explore and make mistakes
-   You have to actively invest in improving your soft skills (and investments pay back immediately)
-   Very few abstractions exist in general application development. Just write the code you need
-   Contrarily, library development is _about_ abstractions. Spend time hunting for an algebra
-   ORMs are the devil in all languages and all implementations. Just write the damn SQL
-   The trouble with functional programming is functional programmers
-   Given a long enough time horizon, you'll deeply regret building on Serverless Functions
-   Types are assertions we make about the world
-   Distributed locking is still really hard for some reason
-   Formal modeling and analysis is an essential skill set
-   Isolation is the most important property of a good integration suite.
-   DynamoDB is the _worst possible choice_ for general application development
-   Most won't care about the craft. Cherish the ones that do, meet the rest where they are
-   Gradual, dependently typed languages are the future
-   You literally cannot add too many comments to test code (I challenge anyone to try)

### Things I have _not_ changed my opinion on:

-   People who stress over code style, linting rules, or other minutia remain insane weirdos to me. Focus on more important things.
-   Code coverage has absolutely nothing to do with code quality (in many cases, it's inversely proportional)
-   Monoliths remain pretty good
-   It's very hard to beat decades of RDBMS research and improvements
-   Micro-services require justification (they've increasingly just become _assumed_)
-   Most projects (even inside of AWS!) don't need to "scale" and are damaged by pretending so
-   93%, _maybe_ 95.2%, of project managers, could disappear tomorrow to either no effect or a net gain in efficiency. (this estimate is up from 4 years ago)

We'll see which of these have flipped at year 15.
