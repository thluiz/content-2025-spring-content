Mostly, I will write about the technical aspects of software development, but before I continue with that, I want to list some books that, in my opinion , every developer should read. Those books aren’t directly related to technical topics. This list is based on books I have read, and it just so happens that there are 10 of them. **I didn’t chase that number.**

Since it’s still early in the year, you can still adjust your New Year’s resolutions and maybe even swap out some books on your reading list for some from the list below.

I’ll write something about each book as a description, highlight, or opinion. So let’s start:

### [](https://dev.to/rndthts/non-technical-books-for-developers-chi?context=digest#1-who-moved-my-cheese-by-spencer-johnson)1\. Who Moved My Cheese? by Spencer Johnson

[![Who Moved My Cheese?](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F0x4mwdhywor9o7b76bnb.jpg)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F0x4mwdhywor9o7b76bnb.jpg)

An easy read, I listed it first because it’s about change, something especially relevant in today’s AI boom. As developers, we should embrace AI as just another tool and use it to our advantage.

From what I’ve seen so far, the majority of developers struggle with negotiations. We’re often afraid to even consider it, whether it’s about salary, perks, project choices, technology, or even getting more CI machines. That’s why this book is such a valuable read.

Communication is an underrated skill for developers, and this classic teaches how to work effectively with people.

Here is a goodreads review to explain the book:

> I want to print many copies of this book.
> 
> I want to print many copies and roll them up.
> 
> I want to roll them up and take them to meetings with my clients.
> 
> I want to take them to meetings and hit them over the head repeatedly while screaming “more… than… 30… years… and you… still… don’t… understand… anything… stop… making… me… write… bad… software…!"
> 
> Seriously.

This book illustrates DevOps principles through storytelling, highlighting collaboration, efficiency, and continuous improvement. While reading, I found myself mapping the characters to real people.

If you’ve ever heard the saying, “Listen to understand, not to reply,” but don’t know where it comes from, read this book. I revisit it every 2–3 years, and each time, I find new insights.

Primarily a leadership book, but if you work in a team, I think it's definitely worth reading.

[![Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fkggxnsbkp4xh2qrpeccp.jpeg)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fkggxnsbkp4xh2qrpeccp.jpeg)

This book explores how we make decisions and the cognitive biases that shape our thinking.

I placed this book after Thinking, Fast and Slow because it builds on many of its ideas, applying them to real-world products.

That’s it for now, until next time, happy reading!!!
