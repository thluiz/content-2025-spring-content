# 20 Ways to Be a Better Friend, According to Experts

> ## Excerpt
> It’s good for your overall health and makes your friends feel their best, too. It’s true: friendships have changed a lot in recent years. We’ve come a long way from the “bosom friends” of Anne of Green Gables days, free from smartphones and Zoom—in fact, you’ve likely noticed that current-day friendships are a lot different from the ones you had when you were in school. It may feel as if a quick hello here and there on social media, or the occasional text, will suffice, but it’s really not the way to build deeper friendships with those you care about. If you truly want to know the ways to be a better friend, it’s something that requires a level of commitment. Friendship expert, author, speaker, life coach, and owner of An Imperfectly Perfect Life, LLC Shari Leid says that it’s the small, thoughtful gestures—the little things—that make a friendship truly flourish. “Whether it’s remembering a birthday, offering a word of encouragement before a big interview, or just being there when it matters most, these actions are like the sprinkles that sweeten the bond,” she says. Leid also notes that being a good friend is “an investment that pays dividends in both health and happiness, growing stronger with time.” In other words? Everybody wins when you’re a better friend. Being a better friend can also help you see the best in people, which can make you a better person in the process. Nina Badzin, host of the podcast Dear Nina: Conversations About Friendship, says that too many people collect evidence on how their friends have come up short in some way. “The only elements of a friendship you can control are your own behaviors,” she says. “Being a good friend is what yields better friendships. And it’s widely agreed upon that healthy relationships, which include close friendships, are essential for your mental and physical health at all ages.”
