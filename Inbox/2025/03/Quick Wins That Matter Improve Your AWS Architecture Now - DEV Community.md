I know, I know, this isn’t exactly a new topic. And yes, everyone is talking about Generative AI these days. But let’s be honest: the AWS Well-Architected Framework is still one of the **most valuable resources** for building in the cloud.

I’ll admit it. I hadn’t given it much thought before. But now? Its value is crystal clear. If you're building on AWS, doesn't it make sense to follow **AWS's own best practices and recommendations** to create scalable, secure, and cost-efficient systems?

Seems too obvious, right?

Also, the AWS Well-Architected Framework is extended and complex because it contains much information, but if you can apply a few things in your real projects, aren't you interested?

> I first wrote a similar version of this article in my blog, [playingaws.com](https://www.playingaws.com/), where I share hands-on AWS insights. But since quick wins are always useful, I thought it made sense to bring it here too!

In this article, we’re focusing on **quick wins: practical, actionable steps you can take right now to improve your AWS architecture** by following the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

Each of the Six Pillars is packed with best practices, and `while implementing the entire framework takes time, there are some small changes you can make today that will have an immediate impact`.

This guide breaks down **pillar-by-pillar quick wins** that are easy to implement and can immediately improve your AWS workloads in terms of operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability.

Once you understand the six pillars ([more info here](https://www.playingaws.com/posts/the-six-pillars-of-aws-well-architected-framework-best-practices-for-cloud-success/), you can jump straight into these actionable insights.

Quick wins are a great way to start with the AWS Well-Architected Framework because they:

-   `offer immediate improvements` without requiring a complete revision of your cloud environment.
-   enhance performance, security, and cost-efficiency quickly.
-   help teams `build momentum` before tackling more complex optimizations.

By implementing these **small but impactful changes first**, you can see real benefits fast and implement more complex strategies after that.
